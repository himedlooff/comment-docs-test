# Dox-ray Angular demo

An Angular playground to test out Dox-ray.


## Getting started

### Installing dependencies (one time)

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) however you'd like.

Then Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```

### Developing

Each time you fetch from upstream,
install dependencies with npm,
update vendor files with `grunt vendor`,
then run `grunt` to build everything:

```bash
$ npm install
$ grunt vendor
$ grunt
```
